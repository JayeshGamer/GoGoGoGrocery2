# Navigation and Redirect Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **AndroidManifest.xml - Missing Activity Declarations**
- **Problem**: CategoriesActivity and OrderDetailActivity were not declared in the manifest
- **Fix**: Added both activities to the manifest with `android:exported="false"`
- **Impact**: Activities can now be launched without crashes

### 2. **HomeActivity - Wrong Bottom Navigation Target**
- **Problem**: Bottom navigation "Categories" button was redirecting to ProductListActivity instead of CategoriesActivity
- **Fix**: Changed navigation target from `ProductListActivity.class` to `CategoriesActivity.class`
- **Impact**: Users can now properly navigate to the categories page from the home screen

### 3. **ProductDetailActivity - Missing Data Validation**
- **Problem**: No validation for product data received from Intent, causing crashes when data was missing
- **Fix**: Added validation check for required fields (productId, productName, productPrice)
- **Impact**: App now gracefully handles invalid product data and shows error message instead of crashing

### 4. **ProductAdapter - Navigation Flags**
- **Problem**: Product clicks weren't properly clearing the back stack
- **Fix**: Added `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP` to Intent when navigating to ProductDetailActivity

### 5. **CategoryAdapter - Navigation Flags**
- **Problem**: Category clicks weren't properly managing navigation stack
- **Fix**: Added `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP` to Intent when navigating to ProductListActivity
- **Impact**: Better navigation flow when browsing categories

### 6. **CategoryGridAdapter - Navigation Flags**
- **Problem**: Same as CategoryAdapter but for the grid layout adapter
- **Fix**: Added `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP` to Intent
- **Impact**: Consistent navigation behavior across all category views

### 7. **ProductListActivity - Category Filtering Support**
- **Problem**: Activity wasn't handling category-specific filtering when navigating from categories
- **Fix**:

  - Extract category data from Intent extras
  - Update title to show category name when filtering
- **Impact**: Users can now see products filtered by category

   - Verify product details display correctly
   - Verify quantity controls work
   - Verify "Buy Now" redirects to checkout with correct data

2. **Category Navigation**:

## Technical Details

### Intent Flags Used:
- `FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP`: Clears all activities on top of the target activity in the stack

### Data Passed Between Activities:
- **To ProductDetailActivity**: product_id, product_name, product_price, product_image, product_description, product_unit, product_rating
- **To ProductListActivity**: category_id, category_name (optional for filtering)
- **To CheckoutActivity**: product_id, product_name, product_price, product_image, quantity, total_amount

### Error Handling:
- Product data validation in ProductDetailActivity
- Empty state handling in SearchActivity
- Null checks for all Intent extras
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## Remaining Minor Warnings (Non-Critical)

These are code quality warnings that don't affect functionality:
- Unused imports
- Fields that could be marked as final
- String literals that should use resource strings (for internationalization)
- Unused utility classes

These can be cleaned up in a future refactoring but don't impact the redirect functionality.
