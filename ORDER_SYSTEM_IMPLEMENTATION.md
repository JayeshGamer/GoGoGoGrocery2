## 📊 Order Status Management

The system supports multiple order statuses:

- **delivered** - Order completed
- **cancelled** - Order cancelled

These can be updated using `OrderRepository.updateOrderStatus()`

---

## 💰 Pricing Calculation

```java
Subtotal = Product Price × Quantity
Delivery Fee = ₹30 (fixed)
Tax = Subtotal × 5%
Total = Subtotal + Delivery Fee + Tax
```

Example:
- Product: Fresh Orange @ ₹99/kg
- Quantity: 2 kg
- Subtotal: ₹198
- Delivery: ₹30
- Tax (5%): ₹10
- **Total: ₹238**
