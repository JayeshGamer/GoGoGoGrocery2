# Database Population Guide

## Problem Fixed

**Issue:** "No products available" redirection error in the category section.

**Root Cause:** Products were being stored with a `category` field (e.g., "Fruits & Vegetables") but queries were searching by `categoryId` (e.g., "cat_fruits_vegetables"), causing a mismatch that resulted in no products being found.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated Product Model**
   - Added `categoryId` field to the Product class
   - Now stores both category name and category ID for proper filtering

### 2. **Fixed FirebaseDataPopulator**
   - Updated to include `categoryId` when creating products
   - Properly maps category names to their IDs
   - Creates 12 categories and 70+ products with proper relationships

### 3. **Improved ProductListActivity**
   - Better handling of empty product results
   - No longer redirects infinitely when no products are found
   - Shows appropriate empty state message

### 4. **Created Database Populator Tool**
   - New activity to easily populate the database
   - User-friendly interface with progress indicator
   - Automated batch script for quick access

## How to Populate the Database

### Method 1: Using the Batch Script (Easiest)

1. Make sure your app is installed on your device/emulator
2. Run the batch script:
   ```
   populate_database.bat
   ```
3. The Database Populator screen will open automatically
4. Click the "Populate Database" button
5. Wait for completion (shows success message)

### Method 2: Using ADB Command

1. Install the app on your device/emulator
2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```
   adb shell am start -n com.grocerygo/.DatabasePopulatorActivity
   ```
3. Click "Populate Database" button in the app

### Method 3: Add a Menu Option (Manual)

You can add a button in your app (e.g., in HomeActivity or ProfileActivity) to launch the Database Populator:

```java
Button btnPopulateDB = findViewById(R.id.btnPopulateDB);
btnPopulateDB.setOnClickListener(v -> {
    startActivity(new Intent(this, DatabasePopulatorActivity.class));
});
```

## Verification Steps

After populating the database:

1. **Check Categories Screen**
   - Navigate to Categories
   - You should see 12 categories with product counts

2. **Check Products by Category**
   - Click on any category
   - Products for that category should load without errors
   - No infinite redirection

3. **Check Firebase Console**
   - Go to Firebase Console â†’ Firestore Database
   - Verify `categories` collection has 12 documents
   - Verify `products` collection has 70+ documents
   - Check that products have both `category` and `categoryId` fields

## Building the App

To rebuild the app with these changes:

```bash
# Clean build
gradlew clean

# Build and install
gradlew installDebug

# Or use the combined script
build_and_debug.bat
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot resolve symbol 'activity_database_populator'"
**Solution:** Clean and rebuild the project:
```bash
gradlew clean build
```

### Issue: Activity doesn't launch
**Solution:** 
1. Verify the app is installed: `adb shell pm list packages | findstr grocerygo`
2. Check logcat for errors: `adb logcat | findstr DatabasePopulator`

### Issue: Products still not showing
**Solution:**
1. Check Firebase connection (ensure google-services.json is correct)
2. Verify Firebase rules allow read/write
3. Check internet connection on device/emulator

### Issue: Duplicate data after running multiple times
**Solution:** The populator uses document IDs, so running it multiple times will update existing data, not duplicate it.

---

## Firebase Rules

Make sure your Firestore rules allow reading and writing:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /categories/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
    match /products/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```
