# Automatic Order Delivery Implementation

## Overview
Orders now automatically change from "confirmed" to "delivered" status after 20 seconds, without manual intervention.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made to AdminPanelActivity.java

1. **Added Import for Handler**
   - `import android.os.Handler;`
   - `import android.os.Looper;`

2. **Updated `assignDeliveryPartner()` Method**
   - When a delivery partner is assigned, the order is automatically confirmed
   - A scheduled task is triggered to mark the order as delivered after 20 seconds
   - User receives feedback: "Delivery partner assigned and order confirmed! Auto-delivery in 20 seconds..."

3. **Added `scheduleAutoDelivery()` Method**
   - Uses Android Handler to schedule a delayed task (20 seconds)
   - Automatically updates order status to "delivered" in Firestore
   - Updates local order object
   - Refreshes the order list to show updated status
   - Shows toast notification when order is auto-delivered

## How It Works

### Order Flow:
1. **Pending** → Admin assigns delivery partner
2. **Confirmed** → Order is automatically confirmed
3. ⏱️ **Wait 20 seconds** → Automatic background task runs
4. **Delivered** → Order status changes to delivered automatically

### In the Database:
- Order status field updates from "confirmed" to "delivered"
- Changes are saved in Firestore
- Updates are visible in both Admin Panel and user's "My Orders" screen

### User Experience:

**Admin Panel:**
- Assigns delivery partner → sees "Auto-delivery in 20 seconds..." message
- After 20 seconds → sees "Order #XXXXXXXX automatically delivered!" notification
- Order automatically moves from "Confirmed" tab to "Delivered" tab

**Customer's "My Orders":**
- Sees order status change from "Pending" (orange) → "Confirmed" (green)
- After 20 seconds → status changes to "Completed" (green)
- Order appears in "Delivered" tab

## Testing the Feature

1. Go to Admin Panel
2. Select a pending order
3. Assign a delivery partner
4. Order immediately becomes "confirmed"
5. Wait 20 seconds
6. Order automatically becomes "delivered"
7. Check "My Orders" screen to verify status update

## Technical Notes

- Uses `Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).postDelayed()` for scheduling
- Delay is set to 20000 milliseconds (20 seconds)
- Works even if user navigates away from the Admin Panel
- Updates persist in Firestore database
- No background service required (runs in main thread)

## Benefits

✅ Automatic order processing
✅ No manual intervention needed
✅ Faster order completion for testing
✅ Updates visible in real-time
✅ Works across all app screens
✅ Persists in database
