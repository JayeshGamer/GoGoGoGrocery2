# Cart Update and Payment Selection Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cart Page Not Updating When Items Are Added
**Problem**: The cart page wasn't refreshing when items were added from other screens (like ProductAdapter).

**Solution**: 
- Added `onStart()` method to CartActivity to refresh cart items when the activity becomes visible
- Enhanced `onResume()` to force refresh cart items every time the activity resumes
- The CartUpdateListener interface was already implemented, but now it's more reliable with multiple refresh points

**Changes Made**:
- `CartActivity.java`: Added `onStart()` override to call `loadCartItems()` 
- `CartActivity.java`: Enhanced `onResume()` to ensure cart refreshes

### 2. Payment Options Allowing Multiple Selections
**Problem**: In CheckoutActivity, multiple payment options (COD, Credit/Debit Card, UPI) could be selected at the same time instead of being mutually exclusive.

**Solution**:
- Simplified the RadioGroup listener to rely on its built-in exclusive selection behavior
- Added explicit unchecking of other RadioButtons when one is selected
- Removed conflicting click listeners that were interfering with RadioGroup behavior

**Changes Made**:
- `CheckoutActivity.java`: Rewrote `setupPaymentMethods()` method with proper RadioGroup handling
- Now only one payment method can be selected at a time

## How It Works

### Cart Update Mechanism
1. When items are added/removed via CartManager, it notifies all registered listeners
2. CartActivity registers as a listener in `onResume()` 
3. When returning to CartActivity, both `onStart()` and `onResume()` ensure fresh data is loaded
4. The adapter is updated with new cart items and UI is refreshed

### Payment Selection
1. RadioGroup automatically handles exclusive selection
2. The `OnCheckedChangeListener` detects which RadioButton was selected
3. Explicitly unchecks other options and updates `selectedPaymentMethod` string
4. This ensures proper behavior even with RadioButtons wrapped in MaterialCardViews

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Cart Updates**:
   - Add items to cart from product list
   - Navigate to cart page - items should appear immediately
   - Go back and add more items
   - Return to cart - new items should be visible

2. **Payment Selection**:
   - Go to checkout page
   - Try clicking each payment option
   - Verify only one can be selected at a time
   - Check that order confirmation shows correct payment method

## Technical Notes

- CartManager uses SharedPreferences for persistence, so cart data survives app restarts
- The observer pattern (CartUpdateListener) enables real-time updates across activities
- RadioGroup's built-in behavior is more reliable than custom click handling when properly configured
