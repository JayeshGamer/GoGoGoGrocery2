## ✅ All Features Successfully Implemented

---

## 🏷️ Feature 1: Shop by Categories Layout Fix

### Problem
The "Shop by Categories" page (ProductListActivity) accessed via the "Shop Now" button was displaying categories in a vertical line instead of a horizontal grid layout with proper spacing.

### Solution Implemented

**File Modified:** `ProductListActivity.java`

**Changes:**
- Updated `setupRecyclerViews()` method to use `GridLayoutManager` with **4 columns**
- Added `setNestedScrollingEnabled(false)` for smooth scrolling
- Categories now display in a clean horizontal grid with balanced spacing
- Each row contains 4 category items with equal spacing
- Visual hierarchy maintained with proper proximity

**Code Implementation:**
```java
// Setup categories grid with 4 columns for proper horizontal layout
categoryAdapter = new CategoryAdapter(this, categories);
GridLayoutManager gridLayoutManager = new GridLayoutManager(this, 4);
rvCategories.setLayoutManager(gridLayoutManager);
rvCategories.setAdapter(categoryAdapter);
rvCategories.setNestedScrollingEnabled(false);
```

**Layout Characteristics:**
- ✅ **4 categories per row** in horizontal grid
- ✅ **Equal spacing** between all items (6dp margins from item_category.xml)
- ✅ **Proper alignment** and consistent sizing
- ✅ **Balanced visual hierarchy**
- ✅ **Clean, easy-to-navigate** interface
- ✅ **Responsive design** that adapts to screen size

**User Experience:**
- Categories are organized in neat rows of 4
- Easy to scan and browse
- Professional appearance
- Smooth scrolling experience
- Clear visual separation between items

## 📍 Feature 2: Address Book - Main Address Functionality

### Problem
Users needed the ability to:
1. Add multiple addresses
2. Designate one address as "Main Address"
3. Have the main address automatically display on the homepage
4. Manage (view, edit, delete) addresses easily

### Solution Implemented

### A. Enhanced AddressBookActivity

**File Modified:** `AddressBookActivity.java`

**New Features Added:**

#### 1. Set Main Address
- Click on any address card to set it as main address
- Confirmation dialog asks: "Do you want to set this as your main delivery address?"
- Only one address can be main at a time
- Previous main address is automatically unmarked

**Implementation:**
```java
private void setMainAddress(Address address) {
    // First, unset all default addresses for this user
    db.collection("addresses")
        .whereEqualTo("userId", userId)
        .whereEqualTo("isDefault", true)
        .get()
        .addOnSuccessListener(snapshots -> {
            // Unset all existing defaults
            for (QueryDocumentSnapshot doc : snapshots) {
                doc.getReference().update("isDefault", false);
            }
            
            // Set selected address as main
            db.collection("addresses")
                .document(address.getAddressId())
                .update("isDefault", true)
                .addOnSuccessListener(aVoid -> {
                    Toast.makeText(this, "Main address updated successfully", 
                                   Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                    loadAddresses();
                });
        });
}
```

#### 2. Visual Indication
- Main address shows a "MAIN ADDRESS" badge
- Clear visual distinction from other addresses
- Badge visibility: `tvDefault.setVisibility(address.isDefault() ? View.VISIBLE : View.GONE)`

#### 3. Address Management
- **Add**: FAB button to add new address
- **Edit**: Click edit icon on any address card
- **Delete**: Click delete icon (with confirmation)
- **Set as Main**: Click on the entire address card

#### 4. First Address Auto-Main
- When user adds their first address, it's automatically set as main
- Ensures users always have a default delivery location

**Code:**
```java
// If this is the first address, make it default
if (addressList.isEmpty()) {
    newAddress.setDefault(true);
}
```

### B. Updated HomeActivity

**File Modified:** `HomeActivity.java`

**Changes to `loadUserLocation()` method:**

**Old Implementation:**
- Tried to load from User model's addresses list
- Used first address from array

**New Implementation:**
- Loads from dedicated `addresses` collection in Firestore
- Queries for address where `isDefault = true`
- Displays in compact format: "City, State"
- Falls back to "Baridhara, Dhaka" if no main address set

**Implementation:**
```java
private void loadUserLocation() {
    TextView tvLocation = findViewById(R.id.tvLocation);
    if (tvLocation == null) return;

    FirebaseUser currentUser = FirebaseAuth.getInstance().getCurrentUser();
    if (currentUser != null) {
        String userId = currentUser.getUid();

        // Load main address from addresses collection
        FirebaseFirestore.getInstance()
            .collection("addresses")
            .whereEqualTo("userId", userId)
            .whereEqualTo("isDefault", true)
            .limit(1)
            .get()
            .addOnSuccessListener(queryDocumentSnapshots -> {
                if (!queryDocumentSnapshots.isEmpty()) {
                    Address mainAddress = queryDocumentSnapshots
                        .getDocuments().get(0)
                        .toObject(Address.class);
                    if (mainAddress != null) {
                        // Display formatted address (city, state)
                        String displayAddress = mainAddress.getCity() + ", " 
                                               + mainAddress.getState();
                        tvLocation.setText(displayAddress);
                    } else {
                        tvLocation.setText("Baridhara, Dhaka");
                    }
                } else {
                    // No main address set, show default
                    tvLocation.setText("Baridhara, Dhaka");
                }
            })
            .addOnFailureListener(e -> {
                Log.e(TAG, "Error loading main address", e);
                tvLocation.setText("Baridhara, Dhaka");
            });
    }
}
```
